    "A *linear regression* or *least squares fit for a line* is a common way of fitting a line to a set of point data for two variables, such as on an *x*-*y* graph. In essence, we assume the two values are *linearly* related to one another and find the line that fits the data best. Once done, this provides a means to estimate values from the line where no data may exist in the scatter plot dataset. Not all data should be expected to be fit well by a line, but linear regressions are a powerful method for determining cases when two variables are directly related to one another. A common example might be the temperature at which magma erupts versus the SiO<sub>2</sub> content of the magma, as shown below in Figure 2.1.\n",

    "In order to perform a linear regression, we need to find the equation of the best-fit line, such the one that might relate temperature and SiO<sub>2</sub> content in the example above. To do this, we first need to recall the equation for a line:\n",

    "Thus, in order to calculate a \"best fit\" line to some data our task is to determine the values of the constants $A$ and $B$. Consider the example below in which $A$ and $B$ are known. If we make the rather common assumption that the uncertainties for the values on the $x$ axis are negligible compared to the uncertainties along the $y$ axis, we can say:\n",
