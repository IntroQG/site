    "In many cases, we might expect our data to have some kind of relationship, such as that between the temperature at which magma erupts and the SiO<sub>2</sub> content of the magma, as shown back in Figure 1 in the least-squares part of the lesson. The correlation between two variables can be assessed using the correlation coefficient $r$, also known as the Pearson correlation coefficient. $r$ ranges between -1 to 1, with a value of 1 reflecting data that perfectly fit a line with a positive slope, a value of -1 representing data that perfectly fit a line with a negative slope, and a value around 0 representing data that either are not correlated or do not fit a straight line. You can find a number of different correlation coefficients below in Figure 2.2.\n",
