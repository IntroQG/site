    "Here we present a few new Python concepts that may be helpful in completing this week's exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## While loops\n",
    "\n",
    "A `while` loop is another type of loop in Python. We are already familiar with the `for` loop, which is typically used to iterate a certain number of times. In contrast, a `while` loop is used to iterate until a condition is met. The general syntax is below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    do things\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the basic idea is that as long as `condition` is true, the loop will continue running. Like a `for` loop, the statement of a `while` loop must end with a `:` character and the code that is executed in the loop must be indented beneath the `while` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look at an example."

    "So, what happens here? Well, first we define a Python list of names. After that, the variable `i` is set equal to zero to be able to reference the first index value in the list of names. The `while` loop here is then used to iterate over the values in the list as long as the condition `names[i] != 'Uncle Ismo'` is true. Within the loop we simply print out the current name and then add 1 to `i` in each iteration. As you can see, the loop terminates when the condition `names[i] != 'Uncle Ismo'` is false.\n",

    "### When to use a while loop\n",
    "\n",
    "It is true that a `for` loop can be used for many tasks in Python, but there are certain cases where it makes better sense to use a `while` loop. One example is when checking for convergence of a mathematical equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let's look at how we can use a loop to [find the square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots) of an input number starting from an initial guess. We will do this by iterating and estimating the square root of a number $S$ starting each iteration from the current best estimate $x_{n}$. Mathematically, the equation for estimating the square root is\n",

    "One of the tasks for this week's exercise is to create a function to estimate an effective closure temperature for different thermochronometer systems using [Dodson's method](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00373790). In order to do this we will need to use some kind of loop because the situation is such that in order to estimate the effective closure temperature $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$ we need to also estimate the characteristic time for a change in diffusivity $\\tau$, which depends on $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$. Since we need both values in both equations, a simple option would be to estimate the needed values using iterations and check to see when the estimated value of $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$ stops changing. We can test this idea below. As a reminder, the equations for the effective closure temperature $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$ and characteristic time $\\tau$ are below.\n",
