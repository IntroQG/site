    "Uncertainty is probably a larger issue for geoscience than for many other natural sciences, simply owing to the fact that so much of the Earth is not physically accessible to geoscientists. A nice example of the \"cost\" of uncertainty is drilling for hydrocarbons in deep water. Drill ships cost ~350 000€ per day, and operating an oil platform costs ~300 000€ per day. A large, proven hydrocarbon resource is obviously worth a great deal of money, but as a geoscientist who might help decide where to drill, it should be clear that there is a big price to pay when you're wrong.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is not possible to make exact measurements. For a geologist's compass, graduated in increments of 1 degree, the best measurement that can be made would be some degree value plus/minus 0.5°. We can say the compass needle points to a given degree, but not more precicely than within one half of a degree of that value. Even with extremely precise equipment, there will always be some uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal as geoscientists is to minimize uncertainties by making measurements that are as *precise* and *accurate* as possible (Figure 1.3).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A {term}`precise measurement` has a small {term}`random error` between measurements.\n",
    "An {term}`accurate measurement` has a small {term}`systematic error` from the \"known\" value.\n",
    "*Random errors* are possible to detect my repeated measurements, whereas *systematic errors* cannot be detected by repeated measurements (Figure 1.4).\n",

    "_**Figure 1.4**. Random and systematic errors when the true value is unknown. Here, it should be clear it is not easy to detect systematic error. Source: Figure 4.2 from [Taylor, 1997](http://www.uscibooks.com/taylornb.htm)._\n",
    "\n",

    "Systematic error might arise, for example, from a problem in the measurement equipment.\n",
    "This is one reason why blanks and standards are used for measuring isotope concentrations when measuring geochronometer ages, for example."
