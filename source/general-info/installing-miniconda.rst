Installing Python
=================

In this course we try to provide cloud computing resources that do not require you to install anything on your own computer in order to start learning Python. Of course, **it is absolutely possible to do programming with Python on your own computer**.
First, you need to install Python.

The purpose of this page is to help you to install Python and different Python packages into your own computer.
Even though it is possible to install Python from the `Python homepage <https://www.python.org/>`_, **we highly recommend using** `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ to install Python.
Miniconda comes with Python and a small number of essential packages.
Additional packages can be installed using the package management systems `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ or `conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`__.
Both offer similar functionality, but we suggest using mamba because it is significantly faster for installing the libraries needed for using Python for GIS.

Miniconda is a light-weight version of `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_ which is an open source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment.
In short, it makes life much easier when installing new tools for use in Python.
The full anaconda installation comes with all packages needed in the Introduction to Quantitative Geology course (and much more!), but Miniconda allows us to save some disk space and avoid package conflicts (important for those installing GIS packages!).

In case you already have Anaconda installed on your computer, you can continue using that during the Introduction to Quantitative Geology course without a problem. **However, if you are new to Python and have not yet installed anything,** we recommend you start by installing `Miniconda  <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ on your computer.

.. admonition:: Do I need to install anything?

    As noted above, you can complete the Introduction to Quantitative Geology course without installing anything on your own computer!
    Each lesson contains a launch button for running the code **interactively in your web browser**.

Install Miniconda
-----------------

You can find several versions of Miniconda for different operating systems on the `Miniconda dowload page <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`__.
Details on the installation for Windows, macOS and Linux users below.
**Note**: We recommend using Miniconda based on Python 3.8 for this course.

Windows
~~~~~~~

.. admonition:: Miniconda for UH Windows computers

    Before proceeding with the installation instructions below, you should check whether you are able to install Miniconda using the Software Center on Windows computers administered by the University of Helsinki.
    If this option is available to you, we suggest installing Miniconda that way (and you can ignore the installation instructions in this section and jump to the section on `Installing the IntroQG packages`_.

To install Miniconda, visit the `Miniconda download page <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#windows-installers>`__ and download the **Miniconda3 Windows 64-bit** installer for Windows.

.. figure:: img/miniconda-windows.png

    :alt: Downloading Miniconda for Windows

Install Miniconda to your computer by double clicking the installer and install it into a directory you want (needs admin rights).
Install it for **all users** and use default settings.

After the installation is completed, test that the package manager ``conda`` works by
`opening a command prompt as an admin user <http://www.howtogeek.com/194041/how-to-open-the-command-prompt-as-administrator-in-windows-8.1/>`_ and running command ``conda --version``.
If the command returns a version number of conda (e.g. ``conda 4.10.3``) everything is working correctly.

.. admonition:: Windows admin rights for UH computers

    Windows users with a **computer administered by the University of Helsinki**: If you don't have **administrator rights** on your computer, you might want to apply for an admin account.
    `Read more about administrator rights and software installations <https://helpdesk.it.helsinki.fi/en/instructions/computer-and-printing/workstation-administrator-rights>`__.

macOS
~~~~~

Visit the `Miniconda download page <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#macosx-installers>`__ and download the Python 3.8 installer for macOS.

.. figure:: img/miniconda-macos.png

**Install Miniconda 3 and add it to system path:**

.. code-block::

    # Download and install Anaconda
    sudo wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    sudo bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

    # Add Anaconda installation permanently to PATH variable
    nano ~/.bashrc

    # Add following line at the end of the file and save (EDIT ACCORDING YOUR INSTALLATION PATH)
    export PATH=$PATH:/PATH_TO_MINICONDA/miniconda3/bin:/PATH_TO_MINICONDA/miniconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages

Installing the IntroQG packages
-------------------------------

As noted above, we will be using the mamba package installer to manage the installation of Python packages in Miniconda.
To do this, we must first install mamba and then download some Python environment files that contain the list of packages used in the Introduction to Quantitative Geology course.
This will ensure the Python environment on your computer is the same as that used in the cloud computing system for the course.
The steps for installing the IntroQG packages are below.

Installing mamba
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get started we will install the mamba package manager in our new Miniconda environment (are you tired of all the snake references yet?).
We can install mamba by opening a terminal window or command prompt in Windows (as an admin user) and running the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install mamba
    conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge

If you're curious, you can find more about mamba in the `online user guide <https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`__ which covers most of the basic things, such as installing new packages.

Downloading the Python environment files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The files needed for creating the IntroQG environment can be `found on GitHub <https://github.com/introqg/python-environments/>`__.

**If you are already familiar with using git**, you can clone the repository containing the files by typing

.. code-block:: bash

    # Clone IntroQG environment files
    git clone https://github.com/introqg/python-environments/

**If you are not familiar with git**, you can visit the `GitHub repository with the environment files <https://github.com/introqg/python-environments/>`__, click on the green **Code** button, and select Download ZIP to download a copy of the files.

.. figure:: img/python-environment.png
    :width: 600px
    :align: center
    :alt: Downloading the python-environments files

After downloading the files, extract the zip file to your computer.

Installing the packages (student)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have obtained the code (either by cloning with git or downloading otherwise) can return to your terminal window, change to the directory where you have downloaded the files and create the environment as shown below.
For example, on macOS or Linux you would do the following.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Change to directory containing environment files
    cd python-environments
    
    # Create the environment using mamba
    mamba env create -f introqg-student.yml

    # Activate the new environment and update Jupyter
    # NOTE: conda is used to activate an environment!
    conda activate introqg-student
    sh postBuild

This creates a new Python virtual environment called ``introqg-student``, which contains the packages listed in the file ``introqg-student.yml``. The new environment is helpful because it will be isolated from other Python packages you might install on your computer and ensure you have all of the packages needed for this course. Finally, the last steps will ensure that the Jupyter environment in the new Python installation has all of its extensions enabled (such as ``jupyterlab-git``).

To use the environment (since it will not be the default environment on your computer) you should type something like the following whenever you open a terminal window to use Python.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Activate the your Python environment
    conda activate introqg-student
    
Installing the packages (teacher)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have obtained the code (either by cloning with git or downloading otherwise) can return to your terminal window, change to the directory where you have downloaded the files and create the environment as shown below.
For example, on macOS or Linux you would do the following.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Change to directory containing environment files
    cd python-environments
    
    # Create the environment using mamba
    mamba env create -f introqg-teacher.yml

    # Activate the new environment and update Jupyter
    # NOTE: conda is used to activate an environment!
    conda activate introqg-teacher
    sh postBuild

This creates a new Python virtual environment called ``introqg-teacher``, which contains the packages listed in the file ``introqg-teacher.yml``. The new environment is helpful because it will be isolated from other Python packages you might install on your computer and ensure you have all of the packages needed for this course. Finally, the last steps will ensure that the Jupyter environment in the new Python installation has all of its extensions enabled (such as ``jupyterlab-git``).

To use the environment (since it will not be the default environment on your computer) you should type something like the following whenever you open a terminal window to use Python.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Activate the your Python environment
    conda activate introqg-teacher
    
The teacher environment is identical to the student environment with the addition of several packages needed for grading assignments using `nbgrader <https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__.

Running JupyterLab
------------------

We use `JupyerLab <https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html>`__ as the main developing environment during this course.

you can start a JupyterLab instance by running this command (notice the space between the words!):

.. code-block:: bash

    jupyter lab

After running the command, JupyterLab should open up automatically in a browser window.

Additional notes
----------------

You can install new packages using the `mamba install <https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/mamba.html>`__ command.
The basic syntax for installing packages is ``mamba install package-name``.
In addition, we also want to specify the **channel** from where the package is downloaded using the parameter ``-c``.

**Installing the pandas package from the conda-forge channel:**

.. code-block:: bash

    mamba install -c conda-forge pandas

Once you run this command, you will see also other packages getting installed and/or updated as mamba checks for dependencies of the installed package.
Read more about package installations in the `mamba documentation <https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced_usage/detailed_operations.html>`__
It's a good idea to search for installation instructions for each package online.

.. admonition:: Conda channels

    `Conda channels <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/channels.html>`__ used by mamba and are remote locations where packages are stored.
    During this course (and in general when installing packages for scientific computing and GIS analysis) we download most packages from the `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org/#about>`__ channel.


.. admonition:: Conflicting packages

    A good rule of thumb is to **always install packages from the same channel** (for this course, we prefer the ``conda-forge`` channel).
    In case you encounter an error message when installing new packages, you might want to first check the versions and channels of existing
    packages using the `mamba list` command before trying again.
