Uncertainty
===========

Uncertainty is probably a larger issue for geoscience than for many
other natural sciences, simply owing to the fact that so much of the
Earth is not physically accessible to geoscientists. A nice example of
the "cost" of uncertainty is drilling for hydrocarbons in deep water.
Drill ships cost ~350 000€ per day, and operating an oil platform costs
~300 000€ per day. A large, proven hydrocarbon resource is obviously
worth a great deal of money, but as a geoscientist who might help decide
where to drill, it should be clear that there is a big price to pay when
you're wrong.

Some general uncertainty concepts
---------------------------------

It is not possible to make exact measurements. For a geologist's
compass, graduated in increments of 1 degree, the best measurement that
can be made would be some degree value plus/minus 0.5°. We can say the
compass needle points to a given degree, but not more precicely than
within one half of a degree of that value. Even with extremely precise
equipment, there will always be some uncertainty.

Our goal as geoscientists is to minimize uncertainties by making
measurements that are as *precise* and *accurate* as possible (Figure
3).

***Precise*** measurements have small *random errors* between
measurements. ***Accurate*** measurements have small *systematic errors*
from the "known" values. ***Random errors*** are possible to detect my
repeated measurements, whereas ***systematic errors*** cannot be
detected by repeated measurements (Figure 4).

when the true value is unknown. Here, it should be clear it is not easy
to detect systematic error. Source: Figure 4.1 from `Taylor,

Systematic error might arise, for example, from a problem in the
measurement equipment. This is one reason why blanks and standards are
used for measuring isotope concentrations when measuring geochronometer
ages.
