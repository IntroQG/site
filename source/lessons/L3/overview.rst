Lesson 3 overview
=================

This week we encounter our first common geoscience equation, the diffusion equation, and the lesson for this week differs slightly from the previous lessons.
We will start with two lectures about the diffusion equation in general and its applications for mineral dating.
As usual we will finish with the exercise for this week.

Learning objectives
-------------------

After completing this week's lesson you should be able to:

- Explain the general concept of the diffusion equation and its physical meaning
- Explain the idea of an effective closure temperature, and how it relates to thermochronology and diffusion
