Lesson 7 overview
=================

In part two of the :doc:`exercises for the final two weeks of the course <../L6/intro-to-exercises>` we will combine the thermochronometer age prediction code used last week with an age dataset from the Bhutan Himalaya to quantify the long-term rates of erosion recorded in the thermochronometer data.
These results will be presented in detail in your :doc:`final paper <../../final-paper/final-report>`\ .
