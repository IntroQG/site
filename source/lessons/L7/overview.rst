Lesson 7 overview
=================

In part two of the :doc:`exercises for the final two weeks of the course <../L6/intro-to-exercises>`__ we will combine the thermochronometer age prediction code used last week with an age dataset from the Bhutan Himalaya to quantify the long-term rates of erosion recorded in the thermochronometer data.
These results will be presented in detail in your :doc:`final paper <../../final-paper/final-report>`\ .

The materials below may be useful for completing the exercise and final paper.

    Learning objectives
    -------------------
    After completing this week's lesson you should be able to:

        - State what a fluid is and how its flow is related to its viscosity
        - Explain why geological fluids deform in a nonlinear fashion
        - Model the flow of ice in valley glaciers using viscous flow equations

Lesson video
------------

A lesson video will be added after the lesson.
