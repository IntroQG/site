Lesson 5 overview
==================

This week we will be introduced to the equations that govern the flow of viscous materials.
At depths greater than those where rocks deform in a brittle manner, crustal and mantle rocks can be treated as viscous fluids with very high viscosities.
Ice also behaves as a viscous fluid in glaciers, which will be further explored in :doc:`this week's exercise <exercise-5>`.

Learning objectives
-------------------

After completing this week's lesson you should be able to:

- State what a fluid is and how its flow is related to its viscosity
- Explain why geological fluids deform in a nonlinear fashion
- Model the flow of ice in valley glaciers using viscous flow equations
