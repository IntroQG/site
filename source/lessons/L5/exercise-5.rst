General hints for Exercise 5
----------------------------

Problem 1: Solving for the unknown pressures in Equation 10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Part 2 of Problem 1 you’re asked to solve for the term :math:`\left((p_{1} - p_{0}) / L \right)^{n}` in Equation 10.
To help you know whether or not you’ve done this properly, I’ve given a table of the values you should get below.

+-----------+-----------------------------------------------+
| :math:`n` | :math:`\left((p_{1} - p_{0}) / L \right)^{n}` |
+===========+===============================================+
| 2         | 4215743440.233                                |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------+
| 3         | 8029987.505                                   |

+-----------+-----------------------------------------------+

Problem 3
---------

Solving for the unknown term in Equation 19
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similar to Problem 1, you’re again asked to solve for an unknown term in Equation 19, in this case :math:`\gamma_{x}^{n}`\ .
As above, you have a table of values below to help you check whether or not you’ve properly solved your equation for :math:`\gamma_{x}^{n}`\ .

+-----------+------------------------+
| :math:`n` | :math:`\gamma_{x}^{n}` |
+===========+========================+
| 1         | 8333142556260.16       |
+-----------+------------------------+
| 2         | 51263351337.21         |
