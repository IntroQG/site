Hints for Exercise 5
--------------------

P1: Solving for the unknown pressures in Equation 10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Part 2 of Problem 1 you’re asked to solve for the term :math:`(p_{1} - p_{0}) / L` in Equation 10.
To help you know whether or not you’ve done this properly, I’ve given a table of the values you should get below.

+-----------+-----------------------------+
| :math:`n` | :math:`(p_{1} - p_{0}) / L` |
+===========+=============================+
| 2         | 4215743440.23               |

Problem 2
---------

Solving for the unknown term in Equation 19
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similar to Problem 2, you’re again asked to solve for an unknown term in Equation 19, in this case :math:`\gamma_{x}`\ .
As above, you have a table of values below to help you check whether or not you’ve properly solved your equation for :math:`\gamma_{x}`\ .
