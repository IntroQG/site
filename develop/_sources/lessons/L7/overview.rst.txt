Lesson 7 overview
=================

In part two of the `exercises for the final two weeks of the course <../../_static/slides/L6/Intro-to-thermochronology-overview.pdf>`__ we will combine the thermochronometer age prediction code used last week with an age dataset from the Bhutan Himalaya to quantify the long-term rates of erosion recorded in the thermochronometer data.
These results will be presented in detail in your :doc:`final paper <../../final-paper/final-report>`\ .

    Learning objectives
    -------------------
    After completing this week's lesson you should be able to:

        - State what a fluid is and how its flow is related to its viscosity
        - Explain why geological fluids deform in a nonlinear fashion
        - Model the flow of ice in valley glaciers using viscous flow equations

Lesson video

.. admonition:: Lesson 14 - Thermochronology II

    There is no lecture video for Lesson 14. All material for this lesson was covered in the :doc:`video for Lesson 13 <../L13/lesson-video>`.
