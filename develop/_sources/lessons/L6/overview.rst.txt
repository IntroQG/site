Lesson 6 overview
==================

This week we will be introduced to the geochronological dating method called thermochronology.
Thermochronology can be used to determine the time since rocks at the surface were at a given temperature in the Earth, and combines several of the equations we have already seen earlier in the course.
This will be the topic of the final two weeks of the course, as well as the :doc:`final paper you will write <../../final-paper/final-report>`.

    Learning objectives
    -------------------
    After completing this week's lesson you should be able to:

        - State what a fluid is and how its flow is related to its viscosity
        - Explain why geological fluids deform in a nonlinear fashion
        - Model the flow of ice in valley glaciers using viscous flow equations
